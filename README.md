# pepperon.ai

pepperon.ai is an open-source machine-learning framework made primarily by _me_.
This project seeks to implement various ML, NLP, and data mining algorithms as I learn what they are and how they work.
I imagine it being like scikit-learn, but significantly worse, in terms performance, usability, reliability and scope. 
But that's okay, because making it will be fun.
